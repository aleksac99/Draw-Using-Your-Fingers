# Draw Using Your Fingers
This is my first Computer Vision program, made in May 2021. 

The program uses your camera, detects a hand, and focuses on index and middle fingers. Using your index finger as a brush, you can paint on the canvas. You can pause by connecting your index and middle fingers. You can choose brush color and thickness. You can also clear canvas and save your drawing.

The program uses MediaPipe module for hand detection, OpenCV module for image processing, OpenGUI module for save dialog box, and some other Python's built in modules.
